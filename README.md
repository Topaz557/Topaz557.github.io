# Portfolio1
 This Portfolio is a description of myself and the practical skills I have learned thus far.
This Repository contains my contact Portfolio as well as a list of the languages I am able to code in.
In this portfolio there is an attached CSS as well as JavaScript, they are what are allowing for the website to properly function. Please feel free to inspect the code to see how I was able to accomplish this.
